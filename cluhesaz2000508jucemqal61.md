We are thrilled to announce that UsableMath will be participating in the prestigious MassCUE 2024 Spring Conference! It’s a significant moment for our team as we prepare to contribute to this vibrant gathering of educational professionals.

The [MassCUE (Massachusetts Computer Using Educators)](https://www.masscue.org/event/springconf24/) Conference is renowned for bringing together educators who are passionate about enhancing learning through technology. This year, on Friday, May 31, UsableMath will be right in the thick of it, presenting two sessions that are close to our heart and mission.

Our first session, **"Designing A Game-Plan for Online and In-Person Math Tutoring,**" has been accepted as a Traditional session. Here, we will delve into strategies and methodologies that are key to making math tutoring effective and enjoyable, both online and in the physical classroom. Our focus will be on creating engaging learning experiences that cater to the individual needs of each student, leveraging the strengths of both digital and in-person educational environments.

Additionally, we are proud to present our second session, **"AI-Enhanced Elementary Math Learning: Practical Strategies for Teachers and Tutors,"** in the Innovation Fair. This session will explore the cutting-edge use of Gen AI tools in elementary math instruction. We will discuss how AI can be harnessed to personalize learning, enhance student engagement, and provide real-time feedback, thus revolutionizing the way math is taught and learned in elementary classrooms.
