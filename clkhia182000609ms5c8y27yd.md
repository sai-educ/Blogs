The [MassCUE Classroom Grant](https://www.masscue.org/inspire/grant-funding-opportunities/) has been instrumental in supporting the progress of the Usable Math open math literacy initiative. It has helped in expanding Usable Math's reach and impact, and we are excited about future developments. The project team is eager to continue sharing their experiences and findings at the MassCUE Fall conference, and beyond.

Usable Math is a testament to the power of integrating technology in education, offering an innovative approach to math learning that is engaging, accessible, and interactive. By fostering creativity, problem-solving, and a growth mindset, Usable Math is shaping the future of math education for the better.

Sharon A. Edwards, Robert W. Maloy, Sai Gattupalli are educators in the College of Education, University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Marguerite Rancourt is a STEM teacher at the Discovery School at Greenfield.
