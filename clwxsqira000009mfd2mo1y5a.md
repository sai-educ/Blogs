We are excited to share that the Usable Math team presented at the [MassCUE Spring Conference 2024](https://www.masscue.org/event/springconf24/) on May 31, 2024. Our session on AI-Enhanced Elementary Math Learning highlighted how AI can transform math education. With custom-made GPTs featuring our 4 unique math coaches—Estella Explainer, Chef Math Bear, How-to-Hound, and Visual Vicuna—we provide personalized learning experiences for students, teachers and teacher educators. These AI enhancements help generate word problems, provide tailored hints, produce engaging images, and incorporate historical and cultural contexts to enrich learning.

Our research insights show that these AI tools support differentiated instructional approaches, enhance both procedural and conceptual knowledge, and offer robust visual and graphical support. Using the Flesch Reading Ease formula, we ensure that educational content is accessible and understandable for young learners. See poster for a sample prompt. Here's more on [the Flesch Scale from Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests).

We extend our heartfelt thanks to all the attendees who participated and engaged in intellectual discussions with us. Your insights and enthusiasm are invaluable as we continue to innovate in math education.

Stay tuned for a follow-up article on our second session, presented by our undergraduate rising senior, Aubrey Coyne. I will share the PNG of our poster on the blog, along with a picture of the team.
