Carnaval dates back to 18th century Portuguese settlers who brought the European tradition of holding balls and masquerade parties before the austere weeks of Lent. The festival absorbed elements of native traditions like parades, costumes, and African-inspired rhythms to become an utterly Brazilian celebration.

Today, Carnaval is celebrated with unmatched passion and creativity. The highlight is the magnificent parade of Rio's samba schools featuring flamboyant floats, glittering costumes, pulsating music, and exuberant dancers. Up to 5 million happy visitors flock to Rio, crowding the streets, beaches, and ballrooms to feel the Carnaval magic.
