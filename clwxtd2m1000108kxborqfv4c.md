We are thrilled to share insights from our presentation at the MassCUE Spring Conference 2024 on May 31, 2024. Our session, "Developing a Game Plan for Online and In-Person Math Tutoring," focused on effective strategies to enhance math learning. With a comprehensive approach that includes assessing, explaining, practicing, and extending, we showcased how to use tools like Illustrative Math, Zoom shared whiteboards, and Google Docs to address diverse student needs.

We emphasized engaging students through personalized questions, multiplayer games, and creative activities like mystery pictures and color-by-number puzzles. Additionally, we highlighted the importance of extending learning by incorporating Usable Math modules and encouraging students to create their own content, such as math story problems and haikus. These methods not only build confidence and memory but also inspire critical thinking and creativity.

Thank you to all attendees who joined us and participated in the lively discussions. Your contributions made the session truly enriching. Stay tuned for a follow-up article on our second session, presented by our undergraduate rising senior, Aubrey Coyne.
