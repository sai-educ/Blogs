Fixed typos, new tools added

Web design has been a passion of mine since a young age, and I have always enjoyed using/exercising it as a way to express my ideas and creativity.

As a scientist and a fourth-year PhD student at the [CoEd@UMassAmherst](https://www.umass.edu/education/programs/stem), I am involved in conducting research related to the field of learning sciences, such as designing and carrying out NSF-funded STEM studies, analyzing data, writing up results for publication in academic journals, and assisting principal investigators in supervising undergraduate and graduate students. In addition to this, I am occasionally asked to create websites for global scientific alliances, research labs, principal investigators, and other science-related projects. As I am always faced with budgeting constraints, I rely on free and open-source tools on the internet to accomplish my website development tasks. Here, I share some tools and resources that I find helpful in putting websites together, such as **icon sets, fonts, stock media, colors and gradient mixers, and asset management apps**. Most of these are free and open-source, however, there are a few paid resources with a label indication.

If you are a web designer, you may likely be using some of the tools mentioned in this article already. In case you are new to web designing, I hope you find this article helpful.
