How would you improve each hint from the perspective of the math teacher? I will also give you what grade each problem is from. My first math word problem is {Max has 127 paper airplanes in his collection. Jody has 79 paper airplanes in her collection. How many more paper airplanes does Max have than Jody?}

There are 4 hints.

| Coach | **Usable Math:** | **AI-friend says:** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Estella Explainer | This question asks how 2 numbers are different. Max has more. Jody has less. | "This problem is asking us to find the difference between the number of paper airplanes Max has and the number of paper airplanes Jody has. When we are asked 'how many more', it means we need to subtract." |
| Chef Math Bear | Subtract the difference 127 -79. Difference is how many more Max has than Jody. | "To find out how many more paper airplanes Max has than Jody, we need to subtract Jody's number of paper airplanes from Max's. So, we subtract 79 from 127." |
| How-to-Hound | Round to the nearest ten 127 rounds up to 130 77 rounds up to 80 | Subtract 130 -80. A rounded answer is almost the same as the correct answer. |
| Visual Vicuna | Find the difference. | "Drawing a picture or using objects can help us understand the problem better. You could draw 127 airplanes for Max and 79 for Jody and then compare." |
