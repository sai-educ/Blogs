A popular summer festival held annually in South Korea is the Boryeong Mud Festival, taking place in July on Daecheon Beach in the town of Boryeong. The festival was originally conceived in 1998 as a marketing vehicle for Boryeong mud cosmetics. The mud from Boryeong is considered therapeutic and beneficial for the skin. What began as a modest event has now grown into a major festival attracting over 2 million visitors each year.

The highlight of the Boryeong Mud Festival is the chance for visitors to play and roll around in large pits filled with the famous Boryeong mud. The cooled smooth mud is imported from the nearby Boryeong mud flats and is reported to contain rich minerals that leave the skin soft and supple. The festival has dedicated mud experience zones for participants to wallow and slide in the therapeutic mud.
