What happens when we let generative AI help us teach one of the most complex ideas in the human experienceâ€”*culture*?

As part of my ongoing project *Equations & Echoes*, I created a short educational video that blends AI-generated lyrics (written with GPT-4o), music composed using Suno v4.5, and carefully curated visuals from Pexels. This experiment isnâ€™t just about making learning funâ€”itâ€™s about making it *meaningful*, accessible, and multimodal.

## Why This Matters for Educators

This video is designed as an **open educational resource (OER)**â€”free to use, remix, and share. It invites students and teachers to approach the concept of culture through the lens of music, metaphor, and visual storytelling. It can be used in:

* **Kâ€“12 and higher ed classrooms** as an *introductory spark* before beginning a unit on culture, identity, or global studies.
    
* **Teacher education programs** to inspire reflection on culturally responsive teaching practices.
    
* **Literacy or media lessons** to encourage remixing, songwriting, or critical thinking about how culture is represented in media.
    
* **Ethics and technology discussions** exploring how we use AI in thoughtful, educational ways.
    

## A Note on Tools & Process

* **Lyrics**: Generated with GPT-4o using prompts aligned with the *Flesch Very Easy* readability scale.
    
* **Music**: Composed with Suno (v4.5) to match the mood and tempo of the lyrics.
    
* **Visuals**: Sourced from Pexels under open license.
    
* **Educational Design**: Informed by my work in STEM and learning technologies at UMass Amherstâ€™s College of Education.
