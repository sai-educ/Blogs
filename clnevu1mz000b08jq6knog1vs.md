Math learning dramatically declined during the pandemic as students experienced months of disjointed remote education. As schools returned to in-person instruction, it became clear many students needed extra support rebuilding foundational math skills.

In response, we rebuilt and relaunched [Usable Math](https://usablemath.org/) - an open online math tutoring system to provide interactive, standards-aligned math activities. Usable Math features word problems and coaching from four friendly virtual tutors: *Estella Explainer, Chef Math Bear, How-to Hound,* and *Visual Vicuna*.

Recently, we published an article in [Digital Experiences in Mathematics Education](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40751-023-00128-3) sharing behind-the-scenes insights into key decisions that shaped Usable Math’s design.

Here’s what we learned:

### Multiple Perspectives Expand Math Thinking

We chose to keep all four coaches, each offering different problem-solving approaches. This shows math isn’t just one rigid way of thinking but a creative, multi-faceted subject. When students experience diverse strategies, it expands their thinking and skillset.

### Google Slides Enable Easy Authoring

Building the system on Google Slides provides an intuitive, no-code way for us to create content. Teachers can also use Google Slides to make customized math materials aligned to their classroom needs. The cloud-based design makes Usable Math accessible on any device too.

### Click-to-Reveal Builds Engagement

With click-to-reveal formatting, users control the pace of problem-solving. Hints appear one click at a time, encouraging students to analyze each strategy before answering. This fosters the habit of thoughtful problem-solving over rushing.

### Growth Mindset Feedback Motivates Learners

We integrated surprise motivational statements after each problem. These growth mindset-focused affirmations give feedback on effort while building persistence and self-belief. Carefully chosen language encourages learners’ progress.

### Authoring Promotes Active Math Learning

Initially we didn't consider student-authored content, but inviting kids to create their own word problems and coach hints was transformative. Writing math stories cements understanding and gives teachers insights into students' thinking.

### Key Takeaways for Teachers

Our experiences developing Usable Math yielded useful insights for teachers designing online or offline math learning:

* Multiple perspectives expand thinking - consider diverse approaches
    
* Build interactivity and learner choice/control
    
* Feedback should reinforce growth mindset
    
* Enable students to actively create math content
    
* Align materials to standards and your learners’ needs
    

While technology can help differentiate instruction, teachers play a crucial role in fostering classroom cultures where problem-solving is valued over speed. Together we can make math learning engaging and effective for every student!
