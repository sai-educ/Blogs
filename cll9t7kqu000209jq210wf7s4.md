In this era of rapid technological advancements, a new literacy is making waves in the educational realm, Prompt Literacy. Born out of the intersection between ai and human communication, this skill is now at the forefront of the educational transformation we are experiencing in the 21st century.

A prompt is a human-constructed instruction given to AI (such as ChatGPT, Bing AI, Claude, etc), usually in simple language, guiding the desired output. For instance, when one prompts ChatGPT to "Write a poem about a cat", the AI, in turn, generates a poem about a cat, adhering to the prompt's framework. This means our ability to construct these prompts effectively determines the quality and relevance of AI's response. Thus, crafting prompts is more than just a task - it's a skill, and perhaps the most critical one in the AI-dominant age we've just entered.

**Crafting Prompts: It's more than just instructions**

Prompt crafting, as researchers from curriculum development and learning technologies from the University of Massachusetts Amherst have [highlighted](https://scholarworks.umass.edu/education_working_papers/6/), is more than just stringing words together. It is a nuanced dance between the human mind's intentions and AI's capabilities. There's an art and science to it, exemplified by the Criteria, Audience, Specifications, and Testing (CAST) model, originally developed by Jacobs and Fischer ([2023](https://www.ascd.org/el/articles/prompt-literacy-a-key-for-ai-based-learning)).

This skill is about understanding the AI tools we interact with, adapting to rapid technological changes, and leveraging them effectively in educational settings. It's not merely about replacing traditional tools but enhancing the entire educational journey.

**Educational Implications**

As AI technology becomes ubiquitous in classrooms, educators need to be prompt-literate. But how can they seamlessly adapt?

1. **Continuous Learning**: Educators need to familiarize themselves with prompt literacy basics, engage with resources, articles, webinars, and workshops, and learn from their peers.
    
2. **Teacher PD**: Whether it's new teacher training programs or professional development workshops for experienced educators, prompt literacy should be a central focus.
    
3. **Experiment and Refine**: Educators should actively practice prompt creation, comparing various versions for the same topic to understand the nuances. For instance, minor tweaks in a prompt could lead to more kid-friendly outputs, as we've demonstrated using ChatGPT-4 in [our previous research](https://scholarworks.umass.edu/education_working_papers/5/).
    

Prompt literacy is swiftly becoming an indispensable skill in our ever-evolving digital age, bridging human intention with AI's immense potential.

Some parts of this article have been revised for easy readability using ChatGPT. Harnessing tools like ChatGPT to refine content for clarity showcases the transformative potential of AI in pedagogy. Just as this article benefited from such enhancements, educators can seamlessly integrate these technologies to evaluate and optimize readability, ensuring tailored and accessible learning experiences for students.

If you are new to prompting, here are some readings you will find helpful: [What is Prompt Literact?](https://scholarworks.umass.edu/education_working_papers/6/); [Public Prompt Libraries](https://aiscout.net/). A simple Google search for ai prompts will also get you up to date.
