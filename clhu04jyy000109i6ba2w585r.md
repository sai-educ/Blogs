In the fascinating world of educational research, my colleague [Will Lee, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamleetn/) and I have embarked on a journey exploring the intersection of emotion, movement, and embodiment in maths learning and game-based learning. Today, we presented our preliminary findings in a poster titled "*Theories and Practices of Emotion, Movement, and Embodiment in Mathematical Learning*" at the Annual Research Showcase hosted by the [College of Education at UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/education/).

Our research underscored the interconnectedness of emotion, bodily movements, and gestures during embodied maths learning (see [WearableLearning.org](http://wearablelearning.org/)). To analyze and correlate the physical movements of participants' game play, we collected footage with log data like math mastery, we experimented with pose estimation packages such as [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose), [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut), and [YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/). However, we found OpenPose to be more suitable for our work. Constructive feedback from my Dissertation Committee Member, Associate Professor and the Chair of the Teacher Education & Curriculum Studies Department, [Betsy McEneaney](https://www.umass.edu/education/about/directory/betsy-mceneaney), sparked interest in furthering the scope of our work to include a research synthesis of the different AI techniques we employed in our study, such as OpenPose, DeepLabCut, and YOLO.

Going forward, we aim to emphasize that doing/practicing maths is not just a cerebral activity but a multimodal process involving physical movement, emotion, and collaboration. We plan to log performance data (such as math problem-solving) to understand the connection between embodiment and math learning at a micro level, to be presented in a real-time facilitator dashboard.

This research was shaped and guided by the expertise of our research advisor, [Professor Ivon Arroyo](https://advancedlearningtech.com/), and consultation from [Professor Jeanne Brunner](https://www.umass.edu/issr/jeanne-brunner). Their inputs have been instrumental in our progress.

### Cosmos Pic of the Week

JWST NIRCAM showing gravitational lensing in action.

Gravitational lensing is like a giant cosmic magnifying glass. When light from distant stars passes near a massive object, like a galaxy, the gravity of the big object bends the light, making the star look distorted or brighter to us.
