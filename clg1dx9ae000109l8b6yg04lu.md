As we progress into an era defined by digital transformation, the importance of digital literacy and Education 5.0 cannot be overstated (Lantada, 2020). Education has been evolving continuously, and the global pandemic has only accelerated the shift towards digital learning environments. Education has come a long way from the days of traditional classroom learning to a more modern, digital approach (Carayannis & Morawska, 2023).

The COVID-19 pandemic drastically changed the way we approach education (Betthäuser et al., 2023). With schools and educational institutions forced to close their doors, remote learning became the new norm. This change highlighted the need for better digital literacy among both educators and students. As a result, digital skills are now considered essential for success in the modern world.

Digital literacy and Education 5.0 play a significant role in achieving the UN SDGs (Carayannis & Morawska, 2023). By leveraging digital tools, we can provide accessible and inclusive education to students globally ([SDG 4](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal4)). Furthermore, digital education can help combat climate change ([SDG 13](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13)) by reducing the carbon footprint associated with traditional learning methods. It also contributes to economic growth and job creation ([SDG 8](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal8)) by preparing students for the evolving job market.
